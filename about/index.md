This website is a collection of links I don't want open in my browser anymore but which I don't want to forget about. It's a Jekyll site and it's [hosted on GitHub]({{ site.github.repository_url }})

You can find the source code for Jekyll at [github.com/jekyll/jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)
